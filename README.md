# 👋 Hi, I'm Nikita — Frontend / Fullstack Developer

Frontend-focused engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable web and mobile applications using React, Next.js, React Native, and TypeScript.

I specialize in building maintainable frontend architectures, complex form systems, and high-performance data-driven applications. I have production experience across fintech, mobile, and fullstack systems — from database design and REST APIs to responsive UI.

I care about clean architecture, performance, and developer experience, and actively contribute to product discussions and technical decisions.
